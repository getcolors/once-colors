# Red ONCE configuration

The project manifest pins both repositories to full 40-character commits:

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "package-once-red": "github:bigconfig-ai/once#<once-commit>",
    "red": "github:amiorin/red#<red-commit>"
  }
}
```

Both commits are recorded in the bundled `red`'s header comment, already
resolved — copy those two lines verbatim rather than looking the commits up.
The shape above is what the finished manifest must look like. Never relax
either dependency to a branch or a tag.

`colors.yml` is a YAML map. Provider settings are flat; applications are the only
nested collection. Quote version-like YAML values such as `3.10`.

```yaml
profile: production
workdir: .colors
once:
  applications:
    - host: www.example.com
      image: ghcr.io/example/site:latest
      github: acme/site
      env:
        DATABASE_URL: app-database-url
provider-compute: digitalocean
provider-smtp: resend
provider-dns: cloudflare
provider-backend: r2
compute-prevent-destroy: true
```

Application `github` is optional, as `owner/repo`. Deploy keys are never
configured here, and they are per repository rather than per application: every
repository named gets one keypair, generated fresh on every `create` and never
stored. The public half is installed on the server behind a ForceCommand naming
every host that repository serves, so a key leaked from one repository cannot
redeploy another's application, while two applications sharing a repository —
one image answering for several hosts — share one key that updates both. The private half is
published to a GitHub Actions environment named after the profile, alongside
`SERVER_IP`, `SERVER_USER`, and `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` — the server's own host key,
so a workflow can pin it instead of running `ssh-keyscan` and trusting whatever
answers on that address every deploy. The previous generation stays authorized
until the new one is published, so a failed publication heals on the next
`create`. Requires `COLORS_PAR_GITHUB_TOKEN`, for `delete` too, which withdraws
what `create` published. Nothing reads those values until a workflow in that
repository does; [github-deploy.md](github-deploy.md) is the example workflow
and the contract it consumes.

Application `env` maps the container variable name to a flat desired-state key.
Do not add that key's value to YAML. Supply it as `COLORS_PAR_APP_DATABASE_URL` or
`COLORS_PAR_APP_DATABASE_URL`.

Provider choices and required fields match the unified repository manual:

- compute: `digitalocean`, `hcloud`, `yandex`, `oci`, `no-infra`
- SMTP: `resend`, `no-infra`
- DNS: `cloudflare`, `no-infra`
- backend: `local`, `s3`, `r2`

Credentials use `COLORS_PAR_*`, the one namespace every colour shares:
`DO_TOKEN`, `HCLOUD_TOKEN`, `YANDEX_TOKEN`, `RESEND_API_KEY`,
`RESEND_PASSWORD`, `NO_INFRA_SMTP_PASSWORD`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`,
`R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. OCI uses its configured profile;
S3 uses OpenTofu's ambient AWS chain; SSH uses `ssh-agent`.

Application hosts derive all DNS zones. Only listed hosts receive A records.
Every zone receives its own `notifications.<zone>` Resend domain.
