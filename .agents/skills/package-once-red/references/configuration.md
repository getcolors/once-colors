# Red ONCE configuration

No manifest is required. The bundled `red` carries both repositories pinned to
full 40-character commits in its `PINS`, and resolves them itself on first run
into `~/.cache/package-once-red/`, keyed by the pins so a re-pin never reuses an
older tree. Nothing is written into the project.

A project that already has a `package.json` may declare them instead, and those
versions win — the launcher reads the manifest ahead of its own pins, so a
lockfile stays authoritative:

```json
{
  "type": "module",
  "dependencies": {
    "package-once-red": "github:getcolors/once#<once-commit>",
    "red": "github:getcolors/red#<red-commit>"
  }
}
```

Copy those two lines from the bundled `red`'s `PINS` verbatim rather than
looking the commits up, and never relax either to a branch or a tag. Do not add
a manifest to a project that has none: it records the same commit a second time,
and the two drift apart at the next re-pin.

`colors.yml` is a YAML map. Provider settings are flat; applications are the only
nested collection. Quote version-like YAML values such as `3.10`.

```yaml
profile: production
workdir: .colors
once:
  applications:
    - host: www.example.com
      image: ghcr.io/example/site:latest
      github: acme/site
      env:
        DATABASE_URL: app-database-url
provider-compute: digitalocean
provider-smtp: resend
provider-dns: cloudflare
provider-backend: r2
compute-prevent-destroy: true
```

Application `github` is optional, as `owner/repo`. Deploy keys are never
configured here, and they are per repository rather than per application: every
repository named gets one keypair, generated fresh on every `create` and never
stored. The public half is installed on the server behind a ForceCommand naming
every host that repository serves, so a key leaked from one repository cannot
redeploy another's application, while two applications sharing a repository —
one image answering for several hosts — share one key that updates both. The private half is
published to a GitHub Actions environment named after the profile, alongside
`SERVER_IP`, `SERVER_USER`, and `SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS` — the server's own host key,
so a workflow can pin it instead of running `ssh-keyscan` and trusting whatever
answers on that address every deploy. The previous generation stays authorized
until the new one is published, so a failed publication heals on the next
`create`. Requires `COLORS_PAR_GITHUB_TOKEN`, for `delete` too, which withdraws
what `create` published. Nothing reads those values until a workflow in that
repository does; [github-deploy.md](github-deploy.md) is the example workflow
and the contract it consumes.

Application `env` maps the container variable name to a flat desired-state key.
Do not add that key's value to YAML. Supply it as `COLORS_PAR_APP_DATABASE_URL` or
`COLORS_PAR_APP_DATABASE_URL`.

Provider choices and required fields match the unified repository manual:

- compute: `digitalocean`, `hcloud`, `yandex`, `oci`, `no-infra`
- SMTP: `resend`, `no-infra`
- DNS: `cloudflare`, `no-infra`
- backend: `local`, `s3`, `r2`

Credentials use `COLORS_PAR_*`, the one namespace every colour shares:
`DO_TOKEN`, `HCLOUD_TOKEN`, `YANDEX_TOKEN`, `RESEND_API_KEY`,
`RESEND_PASSWORD`, `NO_INFRA_SMTP_PASSWORD`, `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`,
`R2_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, and `R2_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. OCI uses its configured profile;
S3 uses OpenTofu's ambient AWS chain; SSH uses `ssh-agent`.

Application hosts derive all DNS zones. Only listed hosts receive A records.
Every zone receives its own `notifications.<zone>` Resend domain.
